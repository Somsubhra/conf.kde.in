  <p><strong>What is Qt?<br />
  </strong><strong>Qt</strong> (pronounced &#8220;cute&#8221;) is a cross-platform application and UI framework. Using Qt, you can write web-enabled applications once and deploy them across desktop, mobile and embedded operating systems without rewriting the source code. For more details, see <a href="http://qt.nokia.com/products">http://qt.nokia.com/products</a></p>
  <p><strong>What is conf.kde.in?<br />
  </strong><strong>conf.kde.in</strong> is a platform for Qt and KDE contributors and enthusiasts to meet up, share their knowledge, contribute, learn, play, and most importantly have fun. It is the perfect arena for collaboration and exchange of ideas, skills, thoughts among like minded people who are passionate about open source. It aims at furthering the goals and visions of the KDE community and open source among many more Indians and to motivate them to contribute to this noble deed. Through this event KDE - India aims at educating more students about open source software contribution and also strives to teach them necessary skills which shall help not only in facilitating their contribution to open source but shall also prove to be a useful asset to their knowledge and skills. The event is also a place for existing as well as budding and novice KDE members to meet, collaborate and work on new ideas as well as projects and help in creating something which can be used by billions around the world. It is a platform to promote open source among students, among more Indians and also to get them to know about various programs such as GSoC, Season of KDE, Google Code-In which promote the participation of youth in open source and to provide them with the necessary skills.

  <p><strong> </strong><strong>Conf.kde.in 2011</strong><br/>
  Conf.kde.in 2011 was the first KDE/Qt conference in India. The 5 day event was held in March 2011 at the R.V. College of Engineering, Bangalore. The event showcased Qt & KDE technologies and introduced participants to contributing to open source projects. The first three days had talks, tutorials and interactive sessions. Prominent members of the community introduced participants to various aspects of development. It had around 300 participants and was a huge phenomenon in terms of the people that it introduced to open source and to KDE. Conf.kde.in 2014 plans to extend this success further and to spread the vision among many more.
</p>
<p><strong> </strong><strong>KDE Meetup 2013</strong><br/>
KDE MEETUP organised in DA-IICT on 23rd-24th of February, 2013 was the largest KDE event in India after conf.kde.in in 2011 and the first such event to be held in Gujarat.There was a participation of more than sum of 400 students from Delhi, Durgapur, Nainital, Mumbai and also from distant parts of Gujarat. The event saw talks by prominent KDE members and the students were introduced to the KDE community,Qt, GITHub, KDE EduSuite, Plasma workspaces and Nepomuk. There were hands on sessions as well wherein the students were taught how to execute all that they had learnt in the talk and how to build and modify the code used in the KDE applications and also to apply their own changes to them. They were also encouraged to participate in Season of KDE and Google Summer of Code. At the end of the event there was a newfound inspiration within the students, the desire to contribute, to be a part of the largest open source community in the world.

  <div class="title2"><h4 id="registration">Registration</h4></div>
  <p><strong> </strong><strong>Where can I register?</strong><br />
  To register, goto <a href="#">http://kde.in/conf/register/</a></p>
  <p><a href="#"></a><strong>What are the registration fees?<br />
  </strong></p>
  <p><strong>Where shall be the fees used for?</strong><br />
  Since <strong>conf.kde.in </strong>is a volunteer driven event, we are relying on our sponsors for funds. But at the same time, we cannot manage everything with the sponsored amount. The fee amount will be utilized for providing lunch and the delegate kits.</p>
  <p><strong>How can I pay?<br />
  </strong>You can pay online or offline, more details at <a href="#">http://kde.in/conf/register/</a></p>
  <p><strong>Can I get a concession on the registration fees?<br />
  </strong></p>
  <p style="text-align: right;"><a href="#top">â Go to top</a></p>
  <div class="title2"><h4 id="delegate">Delegates</h4></div>
  <p><strong>Do I need to carry any particular documents?<br />
  </strong>Yes, please bring a copy of email that you receive when you registered. If you are a student and you want to avail the student concession then you should bring your college ID card.</p>
  <p><strong>I forgot to bring the copy of the registration confirmation email. What should I do?<br />
  </strong>That&#8217;s fine. Just quote your unique confirmation code at the registration desk. We&#8217;ll get you in! You will find the code in your confirmation email.</p>
  <p><strong>I am a student. But I have forgotten to bring my college ID. Can I still get the student concession?<br />
  </strong>No. Please remember to bring your college ID card.</p>
  <p><strong>I am a student. Can I get a letter for my college authorities mentioning about this event and its importance so that I can get permissions to attend this event?<br />
  </strong>We have a letter of invitation from the registrar of DA-IICT here <a href="#">http://kde.in/conf/letter-for-participation/</a></p>
  <p><strong>I am a student. Will I get a &#8220;Certificate of Attendance&#8221;?<br />
  </strong>Since there is a demand from the student community for such a certificate we surely will give a &#8220;Certificate of Attendance&#8221; or &#8220;Certificate of Participation&#8221; to all student participants. Oh and this certificate will be custom made for this conf.kde.in 2011. :)</p>
  <p><strong>Can I get my &#8220;Certificate of Attendance&#8221; after day 1 or day 2 of the event?<br />
  </strong>No. You can collect it on the <strong>day 3</strong> of the event. We hope you will understand that this to make it easier to manage our limited resources.</p>
  <p><strong>Do I need a laptop?<br />
  </strong>No. But we recommend that you get one if possible. It will help you to try out the various technologies showcased at the event. We recommend you have KDE already running on it.</p>
  <p><strong>Will there be Internet at the venue?<br />
  </strong>Yes. We will make sure that there is broadband connectivity available via WiFi. We might be able to arrange some wired connections as well. Please bring Ethernet cables if you have any.</p>
  <p><strong>Will I get a t-shirt?<br />
  </strong>Of course, if we have enough sponsorship to get t-shirts printed we will surely give away nice t-shirts with the awesome new KDE-India logo on it. Goes without saying. Please do mention the right size while registering for the event.</p>
  <p><strong>Can I get more than one t-shirt?<br />
  </strong>We would love to give you one for each day of the week :). But we doubt we can find funds for such a wonderful idea. So unfortunately, you can have only one for now.</p>
  <p><strong>Will there be some accommodation arrangement for delegates?<br />
  </strong>No. But we will be providing some pointers to that shortly. Please check the following page <a href="#">http://kde.in/conf/accommodation</a> .</p>
  <p><strong>Will there be food and drinks available at the venue?<br />
  </strong>Yes. There will lunch available daily for all delegates who have paid the registration fees. You will get coupons, please redeem then at the lunch counter.</p>
  <p><strong>I have lost my food coupons. Will I still get my lunch?<br />
  </strong>Hopefully. Please contact the registration counter, show your conference badge, someone will surely help you out. But please take care of your coupons.</p>
  <p><strong>Can I join a day later?<br />
  </strong>Yes, sure. But the registration fees would remain the same no matter when you come to the conference or how many days you actually attend.</p>
  <p><strong>I have made some awesome FOSS Qt/KDE applications. Can I demo it at the event?<br />
  </strong>Sure if your application falls under Free and Open Source Software. We would love to see what magic you have done with Qt and KDE. If things work out we will try to have âLightning Talksâ arranged so that you can demo your awesome work to a larger audience in one of the auditorium.
</p>
  <p><strong>I have made some proprietary Qt/KDE applications. Can I demo it at the event?<br />
  </strong>No! As that would be unfair to our valuable sponsors and would lead to ambush marketing. Please consider sponsoring the event.</p>
